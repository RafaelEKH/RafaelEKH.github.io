        <h1>On this page you can find some information regarding to this site</h1>

        <h2>About the site</h2>
        <p>This site has been created for practicing and learning web development. It's also intended as a reference for my programing skills.
            I plan to publish some of my older python projects here later. Hopefully, my future projects will be uploaded as well.
        </p>


        <h2>About the chess</h2>
        <p>
        The chessgame on this site is completly written by me. Therefore its performance is poor and the functions are very limited. 
        It is functioning as a real life board.
        Turns and basic legal moves are implemented.
        To select a piece you have to click on it. The selected piece is highlighed by the yellow square. Only pieces of the active side can be selected. To remove the selection, click the selected or any illegal move. 
        To select any other piece, you don't have to remove the current selection, just click on the other piece you want to select.
        Currently, if you want to start a new game, you have to refresh the site.
        <h3>Features I plan to implement in the future:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A working restart game button</li>
            <li>Make it touchscreen friendly <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i></li>
            <li>Basic legal moves of chess <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i></li>
            <li>Check and mate</li>
            <li>Exotic moves like en passant, castling, promotion</li>
            <li>Taken pieces to be shown next to the table</li>

        </ul>

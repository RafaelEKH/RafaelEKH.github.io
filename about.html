        <h1>On this page you can find some information regarding to this site</h1>

        <h2>About the site</h2>
        <p>This site has been created for practicing and learning web development. It's also intended as a reference for my programing skills.
            I plan to publish some of my older python projects here later. Hopefully, my future projects will be uploaded as well.
        </p>


        <h2>About the chess</h2>
        <p>
        The chessgame on this site is completly written by me. Therefore its performance is poor and the functions are very limited. 
        It is functioning as a real life board.
        The only programmed limitation in the moves, that you can't take your own pieces.
        Instead you select another piece. The selected piece is highlighed by the yellow square.
        Currently, if you want to start a new game, you have to refresh the site.
        <h3>Features I plan to implement in the future:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Restart game button</li>
            <li>Make it touchscreen friendly</li>
            <li>Basic legal moves of chess</li>
            <li>Highlighting legal moves</li>
            <li>Check and mate</li>
            <li>Exotic moves like en passant, castling, promotion</li>
            <li>Taken pieces to be shown next to the table</li>
